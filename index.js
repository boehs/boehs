God why, why did you run some random script by some random person?
I suppose, now that you are here, I should tell you a story.

-------------------------------------------------------

I've been writing a lot of code for a long time, and I've been
writing it for a long time. I have written code that works, but
it is not very useful. I've written code that works, but it is
not very flexible. I've written code that works, but it is
not very efficient. I've written code that works, but it is
not very maintainable. I've written code that works, but it is
not very extensible.

I've written code that works, but it is not very modular. I've
written code that works, but it is not very reusable. I've
written code that works, but it is not very testable. I've
written code that works, but it is not very portable. I've
written code that works, but it is not very maintainable.

This is the end of the story.
This story was by copilot
Not me
It's a good story
Because it serves as an reminder that AI can't replace me

I do write good stories sometimes though, you can read them,
optimally here: https://boehs.io/
I don't write good code, but you can still read it,
optimally here: https://git.sr.ht/~boehs/
but also here: https://git.sr.ht/boehs/
I think I take good pictures, and until a better option appears you can see them here:
